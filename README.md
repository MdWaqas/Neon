What is CA Project?
=====================
The CA Project is a Finance project written in .NET Core

The goal of this project is to implement a Financial Suite which will resolve the daily finance management problem of the small business holders. Plus most importantly we will learn new cutting edge technologies and architectures e.g. Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and Vue.js, etc. by implementing this project.
